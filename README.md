- I love the endless possibilities of the AI and want to encourage people, institutions, politics, science and scientists, as well as artists and designers to discuss the usage of this field of intelligence.
- I mainly use ChatGPT with the models GPT-4 and DALL-E, as well as I use app.leonardo.ai for visual inspiration and image generation
- I create NFTs, they may be of visual, audio, text or mathemathical, semantic, text-based content. I love and admire the world of plants.- 
- I love Linux, especially because of the advantage to act via a terminal.
- I mainly use Ubuntu , Ubuntu Studio, MX Linux, Debian and Garuda Linux. I am not the total professional, but an advanced developer with the focus on testing, integrating, and webdesign.
- I speak german, F
french, english, spanish ..
- I ain't afraid of it but I am not a specialist in coding for exmaple C++, C#, C, and other complex, yet powerful programming languages, as I learned most of my knowledge autodidactic.
- I understand and apply HTML, Java and PHP
- I want to conduct my experience with the language Kotlin, mySQL, C++, C, and especially with the usage of programming environments like Antigravity, Emacs etc...
- I also want to learn SWIFT programming language, to integrate my designs to iOS and macOS devices, too.
--> My aim is the integration of the design princiüples, of the Linux Kernel, to, for example, commercial OS like Microsoft Win 11. There is allready a lot of benefit with the Linux Subsystem for windows....
